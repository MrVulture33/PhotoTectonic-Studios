# PhotoTectonic Studios
## Presentation
This project is a tribute trying to emulate the game Vampire Killer, released by Konami in 1986. This project team is composed by two students of CITM Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain).

The game has been done from scratch in C++ using the Raylib library and ripping the sprites and music from the original game. It contains the first stage and the final boss of Vampire Killer.

## Description
Vampire Killer is a platform game in which the player takes the role of Simon Belmont, a descendant of the Belmont clan, a family of vampire hunters. He ventures into Dracula's castle armed with a mystical whip inherited from his father, in order to slay the evil count.

Vampire Killer was developed and published by Konami in 1986 for the MSX2.
